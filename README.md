### Hi, I'm Meirion Layton

- 🤝 I'm looking for a junior role that involves back-end development in some way, ideally using either Go, JavaScript, or Python, but I'm also looking to learn new things
- 🖥️ I've been coding in Go primarily for the last half a year, focusing on back-end development
- 📚 My Go learning comes from Udemy's "Go: The Complete Developers Guide (Golang)" course and all the Go realted courses on Boot.dev
- 🐍 I've studied ML/RL in Python, have experience with Flask, and have created a full game in Pygame
- 📑 I started coding in 2022 by working through all of Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course
