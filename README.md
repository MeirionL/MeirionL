### Hi, I'm Meirion Layton

- 🤝 I'm looking for a junior role that involves backend development in some way, ideally using either Go, JavaScript, or Python, but am also looking to learn new things
- 🖥️ I've been coding in Go primarily for the last half a year, focusing on back end development
- 📚 My Go learning comes from Udemy's "Go: The Complete Developers Guide (Golang)" course and all the Go realted courses on Boot.dev
- 🐍 I've created a game and studied ML/RL in Python
- 📑 I started coding in 2022 by working through all of Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course
