### Hi, I'm Meirion Layton

- 🖥️ I have the most experience coding in Golang, where I've been focusing on back-end development for the past half a year
- 📚 My Go learning comes from Udemy's "Go: The Complete Developers Guide (Golang)" course and all the Go realted courses on Boot.dev
- 🐍 I've studied ML/RL in Python, have experience with Flask, and have created a game in Pygame
